Defend The Castle
===============

This is the repo for my "Defend The Castle" Game. This is an old project built on Adobe AIR with actionscript 3. It was meant to run on Ios and Android, and it was built in Flash Builder. It makes use of DragonBones to create spritesheets from complex character animations published through Flash Professional. It also uses the Gestouch library for advanced touch screen interactions.

The game was meant to be somewhat of a clone of the popular broswer game, "Defend Your Castle" where you grab the character and throw them into the air while they try to run across the screen and break into your castle.
